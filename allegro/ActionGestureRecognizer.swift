// TODO(btc): Note that one obvious improvement is to subclass UIGestureRecognizer. That makes it so that clients don't
// have to delegate their touches(Began|Moved|Ended) methods to this class. Instead, with the subclass, the UIKit framework
// will be responsible for calling our methods and managing our state. However, this alternative limits us when it comes
// time to report which action was recognized. The addTarget method on the subclass doesn't allow us to communicate which
// action was recognized (as our ActionGestureDelegate protocol does). For this reason, I'm not convinced it's worth the
// rewrite at this time. However, if this class introduces problems, let this note be a guide towards an alternative design
// with slightly different constraints and benefits.
